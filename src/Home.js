      <Header>Hi, I'm Rafa≈Ç, I am a beginner front-end developer.</Header>
      <p>Computers have interested me since childhood, curiosity turned into passions, which is why I decided to graduate from the IT school. There, I wrote my first "Hello World" and started to be interested in creating websites. I made my first commissioned website in 2015.</p>
      <p>Websites and web applications are created in: HTML, CSS, SCSS, JavaScript, Jquery, React, Redux, NodeJs, ExpressJS. I'm using Git. The code is written according to the best practices, such as BEM and DRY. The project is validated and tested.</p>
      <p>As a person I am communicative, honest and objective. I can admit guilt, I am not afraid of criticism, I have a large distance to myself. I try to solve my problems by myself</p>
      <p>Currently, I am looking for a place for further professional development</p>
